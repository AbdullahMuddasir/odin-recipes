# odin-recipes
This will be my first project of the odin project.
It will test all my skills regarding the HTML which I have learned so far.
Completed the initial structure which included the boilerplate and a heading
Next I did my first commit, trying to understand commit was the hardest part but I think i did it succesfully
In the second step "recipe page", made another directory with the first recipe and linked in to the home page. pretty simple stuff.
Did the second commit of step 2
continuing with step 3 i an image to the second page and applied listing of both uinordered and ordered.
